third parties we share information with: <br>Partners who use our analytics services.\nWe provide aggregated statistics and insights that help people and businesses understand how people are engaging with their posts, listings, Pages, videos and other content on and off the Facebook Products.\nFor example, Page admins and Instagram business profiles receive information about the number of people or accounts who viewed, reacted to, or commented on their posts, as well as aggregate demographic and other information that helps them understand interactions with their Page or account.\nAdvertisers.\nWe provide advertisers with reports about the kinds of people seeing their ads and how their ads are performing, but we don't share information that personally identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us permission.\nFor example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers (for example, that an ad was seen by a woman between the ages of 25 and 34 who lives in Madrid and likes software engineering) to help them better understand their audience.\nWe also confirm which Facebook ads led you to make a purchase or take an action with an advertiser.\nMeasurement partners.\nWe share information about you with companies that aggregate it to provide analytics and measurement reports to our partners.\nPartners offering goods and services in our Products.\nWhen you subscribe to receive premium content, or buy something from a seller in our Products, the content creator or seller can receive your public information and other information you share with them, as well as the information needed to complete the transaction, including shipping and contact details.\nVendors and service providers.\nWe provide information and content to vendors and service providers who support our business, such as by providing technical
